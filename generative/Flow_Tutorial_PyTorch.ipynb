Motivation\n\nJust as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Normalizing Flows are **Probabilistic Generative Models (PGMs)**, which describe a probability distribution that we attempt to learn from a set of observed data. \n\nPGMs are useful for generating new samples from the learned distribution, evaluating the likelihood of new data points, etc. \n\nNormalizing flows are PGMs built on **invertible transformations**. Their advantages are that it is typically possible to efficiently **sample** and **evaluate** the learned distributions. Normalizing flows also are **highly expressive** and come with a **useful latent space representation**, since we have a one-to-one mapping between our input and the latent space. Finally, they are also **easy to train**, since we just need to conduct a simple maximum likelihood training.\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will show examples of using normalizing flows to estimate (conditional) probability densities and generate new samples. While some instructive mock datasets will be used for getting to know Normalizing Flows, we will also have one dedicated exercise that will use a Particle Physics dataset in the end. As a framework for actually implementing Normalizing Flows quickly, we will use the **nFlows** package. We hope this tutorial will give you at least a rough idea of how Normalizing Flows work in practice and - most importantly - that you find it instructive and fun :)\n\n## 2b.) Normalizing Flows - The general idea (recap)\n\nAt the heart of normalizing flows stands the change of variables formula. Let's say we had a random variable $U$ and now, we apply a simple transformation, defining the transformed random variable as $X$. Then, the change of variable formula is given by:\n\n$$ p(x) = p(u)\\left| \\frac{df(u)}{du}\\right|^{-1} $$\n\nAs an example, let's have a look at the figure below:\n\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1SoaFiiAtpYMSOepjtZkgZACQeV4Zxwbr\" width=\"250\">\n<br />\n\nWe start with a uniform distribution $U$ between 0 and 1, and then do a transformation $f(U)=2\\cdot U + 1$. This, however, leads to a distribution that is not normalized, so to get a proper probability distribution, we still need to scale it with $ \\left| \\left(\\frac{df(u)}{du}\\right)\\right|^{-1} $.\n\nThe derivative of $f$ with respect to $u$ is 2, and the inverse is $\\frac{1}{2}$, which is exactly the scaling factor that we need for getting a properly normalized distribution.\n\nThis, however, is only a simple univariate example. For the multivariate case, instead of the derivative, we need to scale our transformed distribution with the Jacobian determinant:\n\n$$ \\left|\\det \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{f}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{u}} \\right)  \\right|^{-1} = \\left|\\det \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{f}^{-1}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{x}} \\right)  \\right| $$\n\nThe main idea of normalizing flows is to learn an invertible mapping between a very complex distribution (for example a distribution of a physics variable) and a very simple distribution. Let us consider the \"generative\" part first, where we attempt to generate new samples from a Normalizing Flow. In this case, we start with a simple distribution, for example, a standard Gaussian, and then repeatedly apply the random variable transformations to acquire a complex distribution similar to the input distribution that we want to approximate. Let's say we apply $k$ transformations $f_{1}...f_{k}$, starting out from a simple distribution $u_{0}$ and going to a complex distribution $u_{k}$, then the change of random variables formula becomes:\n\n$$ p(\\boldsymbol{u}_{k}) = p(\\boldsymbol{u}_{0})\\prod_{i} \\left|\\det \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{f}_{i}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{u}_{i-1}} \\right)  \\right|^{-1} $$\n\n\nFrom this formula, we also see the reason why this method is called \"normalizing flows\". The random variable \"flows\" through a series of transformations while staying normalized by the scaling with the Jacobian determinant.\n\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1fHZeW9lKGOPl7lZehy8dY0wxLVzjnQFZ\" width=\"1000\">\n<br />\n\nIn a practical case, our \"complex\" random variables $\\boldsymbol{u}_{k}$ would then approximate our input variables.\n\nSince we choose our $\\boldsymbol{f}_{i}$ to be invertible, we can also run the Normalizing Flow in the other direction, starting out with our complex input distribution and mapping this distribution to a standard Gaussian. This is the direction used for density/likelihood estimation (i.e. if you want to evaluate the likelihood of new data under the learned distribution) and also the one used for training.\n\nFor training a normalizing flow, remember that our $\\boldsymbol{f}_{i}$ are actually neural networks with parameters $\\theta$. We train our flow by optimizing these parameters in a negative logarithmic likelihood minimization (which is our loss function then). So we take our input samples $\\boldsymbol{u}_{k}$, take it \"backward\" through the flow (i.e. in the direction of the blue arrows in the picture above), and then tune the parameters of our $\\boldsymbol{f}_{i}$ such that the likelihood of the so transformed distribution under a standard Gaussian gets maximized.\n\nTo be able to use normalizing flows efficiently, we, therefore, need functions $f$ that are both **invertible** and **have a tractable Jacobian** that is **easy to compute**. Several methods have been proposed so far and today, you will work mainly with so-called \"autoregressive flows\", where the functions $f$ are chosen in a way such that the Jacobian is guaranteed to be an upper triangular matrix, so we can compute the determinant simply by multiplying its diagonal elements.\n","metadata":{"id":"KHlmT4cuSe_-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2c.) The nFlows package \n\nToday, we are going to use the PyTorch nFlows library, which is easy to set up and already contains implementations of many of the different flow models. \n\nDetails and code of the package can be found here https://github.com/bayesiains/nflows","metadata":{"id":"PjLFuT_3Se__"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# the nflows functions what we will need in order to build our flow\nfrom nflows.flows.base import Flow  # a container that will wrap the parts that make up a normalizing flow\nfrom nflows.distributions.normal import StandardNormal  # Gaussian latent space distribution\nfrom nflows.transforms.base import (\n    CompositeTransform,\n)  # a wrapper to stack simpler transformations to form a more complex one\nfrom nflows.transforms.autoregressive import (\n    MaskedAffineAutoregressiveTransform,\n)  # the basic transformation, which we will stack several times\nfrom nflows.transforms.autoregressive import (\n    MaskedPiecewiseRationalQuadraticAutoregressiveTransform,\n)  # the basic transformation, which we will stack several times\nfrom nflows.transforms.permutations import ReversePermutation  # a layer that simply reverts the order of outputs","metadata":{"id":"KcFRcKKFA4gS","tags":[]},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Some background about the different modules:\n\nThe **flows module** contains the implementation of the actual flow models. The classes in this module already implement the functions to calculate the negative log-likelihood and the jacobian determinant.\n\nEvery flow model is defined as a series of transformations, contained in the **transformation module**. Here we will be using two different transformations, `MaskedAffineAutoregressiveTransform`, which provides the actual invertible transformation, and `ReversePermutation` which serves to permute the features within the flow. The final transformation `CompositeTransform` allows for the combining of several transformations into one module. \n\nFinally, the **distributions module** contains the necessary base distributions that form the latent space. In our case, we will use a gaussian latent space, defined by `StandardNormal`.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first model we will want to look at is the Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07057.\n\nThe autoregressive property on a sequence of data $\\boldsymbol{x} = [x_1, …, x_D]$ states that each output only depends on previous data. This means that the probability of $x_i$ is conditioned only on $x_1, ... ,x_{i-1}$. The full probability density $p(\\boldsymbol{x})$ then becomes the product of the conditional densities:\n$$p(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\Pi_{i=1}^{D}p(x_i|x_1, …, x_{i-1})$$\n\nAn autoregressive flow makes use of this property in arranging the dependencies of the input dimensions. In each layer, the output $f_{i}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ only depends on features $x_1, .. ,x_{i-1}$. The reason for this is the simpler form of the jacobian determinant. The matrix of partial derivates $\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{f}_{i}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{x}_{j}}$ becomes triangular because there is no dependency between earlier input dimensions $\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{f}_{i}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{x}_{j > i}} = 0$. As a result, the determinant is simply the product of diagonal elements.\n\nThe variable transformation of the MAF is a shift and scaling operation (i.e. an affine transformation):\n$$z_i = x_i \\exp(s_i(\\boldsymbol{x})) + t_i(\\boldsymbol{x})$$ \nbut it chooses neural networks $\\boldsymbol{s}$ and $\\boldsymbol{t}$ such that they respect the autoregressive property $s_i(x_1, .., x_{i-1})$ and $t_i(x_1, .., x_{i-1})$. It achieves this by stacking so-called MADE blocks (https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03509), which are sets of neural network layers that apply element-wise multiplications of mask matrices to the weights. The mask matrices simply contain ones and zeros, intending to turn off dependencies that would violate the autoregressive property. After each flow layer, one applies a permutation on the order of inputs.\n\n\nLet's now define such a simple MAF with the nflows package. In this framework, a flow consists of a base (latent space) distribution and an invertible transformation. This flow object then has two important methods: `flow.log_prob(data)` returns the logarithmic probability of the data, `flow.sample(n_samples)` produces new data points.\n","metadata":{"id":"EJCJe_sMSfAC"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Fist we define the latent space distribution, in this case a choosing a 2-dim Gaussian\nbase_dist = StandardNormal(shape=[2])\n\n# Now we define the series of transformation that our flow model will comprise.\n# For now we will use a singel MAF layer, we preemtivly implement this as a list,\n# so to make it simple to extend.\n\n# For the MAF layer we need to secify the number of input parameters, as well as the\n# number of features used in the internal FCN layers.\ntransforms = []\ntransforms.append(MaskedAffineAutoregressiveTransform(features=2, hidden_features=4))\n\n# Finally we can combine the list of previously defined transformations into one\n# single compisite transformation.\ntransform = CompositeTransform(transforms)\n\n# The actual flow now consist of the the base distribution and transform together\nflow = Flow(transform, base_dist).to(device)\n\n# we can then use standard PyTorch optimizers\noptimizer = optim.Adam(flow.parameters())","metadata":{"id":"W5Bx-UG7SfAC","tags":[]},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2d.)

Advanced Task","metadata":{"id":"hFe2BWVBTAPn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If the exercises before were too easy for you or if you would like to have an additional challenge in your own time, consider the following task. It's not rocket science but it's very likely to take more time than what we have in this exercise class.\n\nSo far, we have for the sake of simplicity only used a binary conditional variable. However, this would work just as well on a general continuous conditional. If you extracted also the dijet mass (mjj) from the dataset and plotted it. You would see that the signal peaks quite sharply at the resonance mass of 3.5 TeV. We can divide the mjj spectrum into a signal region (SR), ranging from 3.3 to 3.7 TeV, and the remaining sideband region (SB). Drawing events from the SB, you should only see very background-like distributions in the other variables, whereas the SR events should yield a very distinct signal peak in addition to the background. \n\n**Task: Extract and plot mjj. Train a conditional flow model with mjj as the conditional variable, then sample data from the two regions separately in the same ratio as found in the data. Plot the variables and compare them with the original data. Since this task is also more difficult for the density estimator, you might need to increase the model complexity, the number of training epochs and/or the fraction of used data to achieve a satisfying result.**","metadata":{"id":"lKF0ZBzvQnJW"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"######################\n# Add code here\n######################","metadata":{"id":"fKCBbMZSUK8N"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"id":"sbNI8qfkGSm8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
